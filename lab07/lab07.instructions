Programming Assignment # 7 due 04/04/2018
In this assignment, you need to build an app that will move (animate) a solid circle along an elliptic path
like a comet. Give your favorite color for the solid circle. Your app should display a complete trajectory
on an AVD Nexus 6 (API 26). You must make sure the app will run on a lab computer before submitting
for grading. Name your app as ‘My Comet’ which must be saved in a folder named Lab7. Name your
main activity as MyCometActvity. java and the class which extends View class as
CometAnimation.java. A possible path is shown below in Figure 1. But you can do better by finding the
screen width and height and using the dimensions to find the center of the elliptic path.
