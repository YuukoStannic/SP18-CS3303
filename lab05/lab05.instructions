Fragments are smaller pieces of an activity that are parts of a grouping of a views and functionalities. Fragments allow views to be bundled together and to be held within an activity. For example, in a portrait view, a single list of items appear on one screen and a detail view of each item as a detail screen on small screen devices; whereas on a tablet both the list and the detail views appear on the same screen. 
In this assignment, you will create an app that will list all the computer science courses and the catalog detail description of each course using fragments. The list of courses is to be created in the user interface at runtime (dynamic UI).The courses and their descriptions are taken from the university catalog and are given below toward the end and also provided as a text file named Lab5.txt. When your start the New Android Studio Project, you must use the following: 
Folder Name: Lab5
Application name and project: CS Courses
Activity Name: MainActivity (Entry point activity) 
Layout Name: layout/activity_main and layout-land/activity_main (xml for the entry activity)
Name the class that extends ListFragment as CourseFragment, the class that extends Fragment as CourseDetails, the class that extends Activity as CourseActivity, and the course information class as Courses. You are not allowed to use a different set of Java class names for this assignment, if you choose another set of names you may lose some points. Please make sure that your work will run on a lab computer before you submit it for grading.  Sample display using Nexus 6 API 26: initial display in portrait mode is Figure 1, the same in landscape mode is Figure 2. When CS 4391 is clicked the display in portrait mode is Figure 3, and the same in landscape mode is Figure 4. 
Please note that you are not required to have the same colors as in the figures. If you donâ€™t like them please feel free to try a different set of colors but not the same colors as in the class demo app. If you have time research more and get pretty displays.
