This project must be completed as a group assignment of two individuals to a group. Only the designated group individual submits the work and the grade for the group is same for its members. We will use the same groups as decided in class when working on Programming Assignment 4. In the comment section of the entry point activity, you need to give the names of members of the group, the portion of the app coded by each member and percentage of grade each member should get based on the contribution to the project.
